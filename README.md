# PDDB Raw Commands

This repository is a collection of tests and experiments that were useful when adding libstd support to pddb.

Most of this code ended up in https://github.com/betrusted-io/rust/blob/1.62.0-xous/library/std/src/sys/xous/fs.rs for rust and https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/tree/main/services/pddb/src/libstd inside Xous.

Notably, this is the repository where senres was first developed.
